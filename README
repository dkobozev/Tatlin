# Tatlin

Tatlin is a Gcode and STL viewer heavily inspired by Mac-only software
Pleasant3D. Besides viewing, it also supports rotating and scaling of STL
files. It is currently in early stages of development, but should already
be quite usable.

## Dependencies

Tatlin requires the following packages:

- Python 3
- wxPython 4+
- PyOpenGL
- NumPy

## Usage

To launch Tatlin from the command line:

    $ python tatlin.py

You can also provide a filename to load:

    $ python tatlin.py foobar.stl

Mouse navigation

- Left mouse button to rotate
- Mouse wheel to zoom
- Middle mouse button to offset the platform
- Right mouse button to pan

Build platform size can be customized by creating a file called `.tatlin` in
your home directory with the following contents:

    [machine]
    platform_w = 300
    platform_d = 300

## Thanks
